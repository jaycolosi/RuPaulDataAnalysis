# RuPaul's Drag Race Data Analysis 
This project is intended to be a statistical analysis of Queens performance while competeing on RuPaul's Drag Race. As someone who has created a Drag Fantasy League ([DFL](https://www.dragfantasyleague.com/)) for this show, my intended audience are fans who like to know the stats of their favorite Queens and that information when selecting Queens for their Fantasy Team during All Star seasons. For this project, I will be exploring how much influence does a Win in the challenge, "The Snatch Game" and if it determines a Queen will make it to the Finale.
